# Introduction

Byte Forge is a modern hacking and bug enumeration application.

Currently runs with:

- Angular v16.2.12
- Tauri 1.5.3

With this sample, you can:

- Run your app in a local development environment with Tauri & Hot reload
- Run your app in a production environment
- Package your app into an executable file for Linux, Windows & Mac

/!\ Angular CLI needs Node 16 or later to work correctly.
